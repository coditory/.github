# Support and Help

Need help getting started or using a project? Here's how.

## How to get help

Please seek support in the following ways:

1. :book: **Read the documentation and other guides** for the project to see if you can figure it out on your own.
Project's `README.md` is usually a good place to start from.
If is `samples/` directory, explore the examples to see if you can answer your question.
1. :bulb: **Search for answers using Google/Stack Overflow/LLM.**
This is the most appropriate place for debugging issues specific to your use of the project, or figuring out how to use the project in a specific way.
1. :memo: As a **last resort**, you may open an issue on GitHub to ask for help.
However, please make sure it's not duplicated and clearly explain what you are trying to do, and list what you have already attempted to solve the problem.
Provide code samples, but **do not** attach your entire project for someone else to debug.
Review our [contributing guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What NOT to do

Please **do not** do any the following:

1. :x: Do not reach out to the author or contributor on Twitter (or other social media) by tweeting or sending a direct message.
1. :x: Do not email the author or contributor directly.
1. :x: Do not open duplicate issues or litter an existing issue with +1's.

These are not appropriate avenues for seeking help or support with an open-source project.
Please follow the guidelines in the previous section.
Public questions get public answers, which benefits everyone in the community. ✌️

## Customer Support

We do not provide any sort of "customer support" for open-source projects.
However, we're open for hire. For contracting and consulting, send mail to [hello@coditory.com](mailto:hello@coditory.com).

## Development Support

We do out best to use open standards to minimize the initial development friction.
Additional instructions are usually added in development guidelines in `DEVELOPMENT.md` in the project root directory.
