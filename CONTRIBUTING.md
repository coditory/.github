# Contribution guide

## Did you find a bug?

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead refer to our [security policy](/security/policy).
* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Do you have a question or a feature request?

Check if it is already addressed by existing issue. If not [open a new one](/issues/new).
If possible prepare a sample project and provide context to make it easier to solve by maintainers.

## Did you write a pull request that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Before submitting, please read the [contributing guide](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html) guide to know more about coding conventions.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* Open an issue, propose the feature wait for positive feedback.
* Start writing code. If you're in hurry and the code change is small you can propose the change without waiting for feedback.

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted.
